This is a fork of the javascript/html mp3 player made by [antimatter15](http://antimatter15.github.com/player/player.html). It can load music from your hard drive and parse id3 tags.

It should work on the latest version of chrome and possibly safari. Chromium and firefox 4 will probably only work with ogg vorbis files. Internet explorer 9, mobile safari and opera will almost definitely not work.
